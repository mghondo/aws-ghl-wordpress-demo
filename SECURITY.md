## ðŸ”’ Credential Management & Security Fixes

### Recent Security Issue Resolved

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Issue:** Exposed AWS temporary access key in git repository  
**File:** `lambda/response-final.json`  
**Credential:** AWS Access Key ID `ASIA2PUE3CLBXLTX5MHO`

### Actions Taken

1. **âœ… Immediate Credential Removal**
   - Deleted `lambda/response-final.json` containing exposed credentials
   - Removed file from entire git history using `git filter-branch`
   - Force pushed cleaned history to remote repository

2. **âœ… Comprehensive .gitignore Added**
   - Created comprehensive `.gitignore` to prevent future credential exposure
   - Includes patterns for AWS credentials, config files, debug logs, and other sensitive data

3. **âœ… Git History Cleaned**
   - Used `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive file from entire repository history
   - Ensured no trace of credentials remain in any commit

### Security Best Practices Implemented

#### AWS Credential Management
- **Never commit AWS credentials** to any git repository
- Use AWS IAM roles for Lambda functions instead of access keys
- Store credentials in environment variables or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
- Use temporary credentials with limited scope and short expiration times

#### File Security Patterns Added to .gitignore
```
# AWS Credentials and Sensitive Files
*.pem
*.key
.env
aws-config/
**/credentials
.aws/

# Lambda Response Files (may contain signed URLs)
lambda/response*.json
**/response*.json

# Debug and Log Files
debug.log
wp-content/debug.log
```

### AWS S3 Signed URL Security

The exposed credential was found in an S3 signed URL:
```
https://clarity-aws-ghl-demo-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/certificates/123/456/cert-CERT-2025-6806.html?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIA2PUE3CLBXLTX5MHO&Signature=...&x-amz-security-token=...&Expires=1760299389
```

**Security Implications:**
- This was a temporary access key with limited scope
- The token had an expiration time (Expires=1760299389 = ~55 years from epoch - likely test data)
- Access was limited to S3 certificate bucket operations

### Recommended Actions for Production

1. **Rotate AWS Credentials**
   - If these were real production credentials, rotate them immediately
   - Update Lambda function to use IAM roles instead of access keys

2. **Monitor AWS CloudTrail**
   - Check CloudTrail logs for any unauthorized access using the exposed credentials
   - Set up alerts for unusual API activity

3. **Review Certificate Storage**
   - Consider shorter expiration times for S3 signed URLs (e.g., 1 hour instead of years)
   - Implement proper certificate access controls

4. **Security Scanning**
   - Set up GitHub security scanning and secret detection
   - Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent credential commits

### Environment Variables for Secure Configuration

Create a `.env.example` file showing required environment variables:
```bash
# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=your-certificate-generator

# S3 Configuration
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-certificate-bucket
S3_SIGNED_URL_EXPIRATION=3600  # 1 hour in seconds

# WordPress Configuration
WP_DEBUG=false
WP_DEBUG_LOG=false
```

### Code Security Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Environment variables used for sensitive configuration
- [ ] Proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive data
- [ ] Debug output disabled in production
- [ ] AWS IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- [ ] Regular security dependency updates
- [ ] Automated security scanning enabled

### Future Prevention

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Install git hooks to scan for credentials before commits
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `detect-secrets`

2. **CI/CD Security**
   - Add security scanning to GitHub Actions
   - Implement automated credential detection

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Monthly review of repository for sensitive data
   - Quarterly security assessment of AWS permissions
